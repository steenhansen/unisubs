                <p>
                    <span>All of us, whether it's on the job or if we're in an
organization or a club, we all have in some way</span>
                    <span>worked in teams. My family is my best team, the
cheerleaders that support me. In the professional</span>
                    <span>world, the things are changing and teams are really
the solution to tomorrow's problems. <span class="current">The</span> <span class="current">idea that people work together, to share their ideas and
their perspectives</span> <span class="current">is a way of intensifying the learning process.</span> <span>[sound]. University of Phoenix has learning</span> <span>teams, because it really is a substantive learning</span>
                    <span>experience that students can incorporate. Personally,
professional and academically.</span>
                <p>
                <p>
                    <span>The value of teams is tremendous. Not only does it teach a variety of communication skills, such as written communication,</span>
                    <span>public speaking, and virtual communications. It also
teaches goal setting and project management, leadership</span>
                    <span>and how to get things done through other people. It's a great way to accelerate the learning process</span>
                    <span>by being able to cover a lot more material in a shorter
period of time. There will be learning teams</span>
                    <span>in every class you take. So it's best to learn how
to make them work. >> Initially it was an uncomfortable</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>So many of you may know this is planet earth here, right? But ultimately as we really know, it's planet</span> 
                    <span>water. And why is that it's because 70% of the surface area is water.</span>
                    <span>It's 70% saline solution actually. Very similar to the amount of saline solution each of you</span>
                    <span>has in your body right now. So you're a bunch of bipedal bags of saline solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>I live in Western Sonoma County, in the town of Occidental</span>
                    <span>and kind of near the coast up in the Redwood country, some know it as wine country</span>
                    I'm a biologist by birth, one of those characters that chase the creepy-crawlies around
                    <span>since I came out of the womb, and ultimately that's led me to water because ultimately</span>
                    <span>the recognition that the hydrologic integrity of any ecosystem, if it has an imbalance,</span>
                    <span>then the capacity to support life in that system will be always compromised</span>
                <p>
                <p>
                    <span>And so tonight, a little bit of what we want to talk about or what we were asked to talk about</span>
                    <span>is the wisdom of the watershed, and so then we've gotta engage with the anthropomophization</span>
                    <span>of what is a watershed and all of that, and so I wanna dive right into this and I just</span>
                    <span>put together a series of images and slides about water primarily and then we'll get into</span>
                    <span>watersheds and different kinds of things that we can do to engage with or, as you might say, "think like a watershed."</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>So many of you may know this is planet earth here, right? But ultimately as we really know, it's planet</span> 
                    <span>water. And why is that it's because 70% of the surface area is water.</span>
                    <span>It's 70% saline solution actually. Very similar to the amount of saline solution each of you</span>
