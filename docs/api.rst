API Documentation
=================

This is the documentation of v2 of Amara's API. Please contact us
if youâ€™d like to use the Amara API for commercial purposes.

.. note:: The v1 of the API is deprecated, but can still be accessed through
    http://www.universalsubtitles.org/api/1.0/documentation/ . Users should migrate
    to the v2 of the API. If you're missing a feature on the API, please `let us
    know <https://universalsubtitles.tenderapp.com/>`_ .

Authentication
--------------

Before interacting with the API, you must have an API key. In order to get one,
create a user on the Amara website, then go to the `edit profile
<http://www.universalsubtitles.org/en/profiles/edit/>`_ page. At the bottom of
the page you will find a "Generate new key" button . Clicking on it will fetch
your user the needed API key.

Every request must have the username and the API keys as headers. For example::

   X-api-username: my_username_here
   X-apikey: my_api_key_here

So a sample request would look like this::

    $ curl -H 'X-api-username: my_username_here' -H 'X-apikey: my_api_key_here' \
        https://staging.universalsubtitles.org/api2/partners/videos/

Data Formats
------------

The API accepts request data and will output the following formats: JSON, XML
and YAML. Unless you have a strong reason not to, we recommend using the JSON
format, as it's the one that gets the most usage (and therefore more testing).

To specify the format, add the ``Accept`` header appropriately, for example::

    Accept: application/json

You can also specify the desired format in the url, sending the request
variable ``format=json``.

API endpoint
------------

The endpoint for the API is the environment base URL +  ``/api2/partners/``.

Possible environments:

* Staging: ``https://staging.universalsubtitles.org/``
* Production: ``https://www.universalsubtitles.org/``

Therefore, most clients should be making requests against:
``https://www.universalsubtitles.org/api2/partners/``

All API requests should go through https. The staging environment might need
HTTP basic auth, please contact us to request credentials.  When basic auth is
needed on staging, you end up with a request like this::

    $ curl -H 'X-api-username: my_username_here' -H 'X-apikey: my_api_key_here' \
        --user basic_auth_username:basic_auth_password \
        https://staging.universalsubtitles.org/api2/partners/videos/

If you're under a partnership, you might have a different base URL. Please
contact us if you're not sure.

API interaction overview
------------------------

All resources share a common structure when it comes to the basic data
operations.

* ``GET`` request is used to viewing data
* ``POST`` request is used for creating new items
* ``PUT`` request is used for updating existing items
* ``DELETE`` request is used for deleting existing items

For example, in order to request a list of teams the user is current on, you
would issue the following request:

.. http:get:: /api2/partners/teams/

To view a detail of the ``test`` team, you could do:

.. http:get:: /api2/partners/teams/test/

Example response

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "created": "2012-04-18T09:26:59",
        "deleted": false,
        "description": "",
        "header_html_text": "",
        "is_moderated": false,
        "is_visible": true,
        "logo": null,
        "max_tasks_per_member": null,
        "membership_policy": "Open",
        "name": "test",
        "projects_enabled": false,
        "resource_uri": "/api2/partners/teams/test/",
        "slug": "test",
        "subtitle_policy": "Anyone",
        "task_assign_policy": "Any team member",
        "task_expiration": null,
        "translate_policy": "Anyone",
        "video_policy": "Any team member",
        "workflow_enabled": false
    }

Many of the available resources will allow you to filter the response by a
certain field.  Filters are specified as GET parameters on the request.  For
example, if you wanted to view all videos belong to a team called
"butterfly-club", you could do:

.. http:get:: /api2/partners/videos?team=butterfly-club

In addition to filters, you can request that the response is ordered in some
way.  To order videos by title, you would do

.. http:get:: /api2/partners/videos?order_by=title

Each resource section will contain a list of relevant options.

Here is an example of creating a new team via ``curl``.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -i -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H 'X-api-username: my_username_here' -H 'X-apikey: my_api_key_here' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"name": "Team name", "slug": "team-name"}' \
        http://host/api2/partners/teams/

You can use the same fields that you get back when requesting a team detail.

To update a team, you could issue a request like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -i -X PUT -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H 'X-api-username: my_username_here' -H 'X-apikey: my_api_key_here' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"name": "My team name"}' \
        https://host/api2/partners/teams/test/

.. warning:: The above example only includes the ``name`` field for
    illustration. When sending a ``PUT`` request, always include all fields.
    For a list of all fields, see the response to a ``GET`` request.

Partner video ids
-----------------

If you are a partner, you can set the ``id`` field for a video.  Simply supply
the ``usePartnerId`` parameter in your request and we will use your id for look
ups.  The parameter can be sent as a parameter to any kind of API call.  This
is useful if you already have a database of video ids and don't want to
maintain a mapping between those ids and Amara ids.

For example, let's say you have an Amara video with the id of ``yxsSV807Dcho``.
Your application uses numeric id internally and you would like to tell Amara to
remember that this video has an id of ``12345`` on your system.  You can modify
the video like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -i -X PUT -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H 'X-api-username: my_username_here' -H 'X-apikey: my_api_key_here' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"usePartnerId": true, "id": "12345"}' \
        https://host/api2/partners/videos/yxsSV807Dcho/

And then, you can start referencing the video by the numeric id when
interacting with the API. For example, the following call will retrieve the
above video.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H 'X-api-username: my_username_here' -H 'X-apikey: my_api_key_here' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        https://host/api2/partners/videos/12345/?usePartnerId=true

Available Resources
-------------------

The following resources are available to end users:

Video Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a video on Amara.

Listing videos

.. http:get:: /api2/partners/videos/

    :query video_url:  list only videos with the given URL, useful for finding out information about a video already on Amara.
    :query team:       Only show videos that belong to a team identified by ``slug``.
    :query project:    Only show videos that belong to a project with the given slug.
        Passing in ``null`` will return only videos that don't belong to a project.
    :query order_by:   Applies sorting to the video list. Possible values:

        * `title`: ascending
        * `-title`: descending
        * `created`: older videos first
        * `-created` : newer videos

Creating Videos:

.. http:post:: /api2/partners/videos/

    :form video_url: The url for the video. Any url that Amara accepts will work here. You can send the URL for a file (e.g. http:///www.example.com/my-video.ogv) , or a link to one of our accepted providers (youtube, vimeo, dailymotion, blip.tv)
    :form title: The title for the video :form description: About this video
    :form duration: Duration in seconds

When submitting URLs of external providers (i.e. youtube, vimeo), the metadata
(title, description, duration) can be fetched from them. If you're submitting a
link to a file (mp4, flv) then you can make sure those attributes are set with
these parameters. Note that these parameters do override any information from
the original provider.

Information about a specific video can be retrieved from the URL:

Video Detail:

.. http:get:: /api2/partners/videos/[video-id]/

The video listing resource already returns a ``resource_uri`` for each video to
be used when retrieving the details.

Updating a video object:

.. http:put:: /api2/partners/videos/[video-id]/

With the same parameters for creation. Note that through out our system, a
video cannot have it's URLs changed. So you can change other video attributes
(title, description) but the URL sent must be the same original one.

Moving videos between teams and projects
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to move a video from one team to another, you can make a request to
change the video where you change the ``team`` value in the Video Resource.

In order to move the video from *Team A* to *Team B*, you would make the
following request.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -i -X PUT -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H 'X-api-username: my_username_here' -H 'X-apikey: my_api_key_here' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"team": "team_b"}' \
        https://host/api2/partners/videos/video-id/

Please note that the value that is sent as the ``team`` is the team's slug.
The user making the change must have permission to remove a video from the
originating team and permission to add a video to the target team.

Setting the ``team`` value to ``null`` will remove it from its current team.

A similar mechanism can be used to change what project a given video is filed
under.  The important difference is that when moving a video to different
project, the team must be specified in the payload even if it doesn't change.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "team:" "team-slug",
        "project": "new-project"
    }

Team Member Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This resource allows you to change team membership information without the
target user's input.  This resource is only applicable to:

* Teams associated with the partner's account
* Users who are already members of one of the partner's teams

You can list existing members of a team:

.. http:get:: /api2/partners/teams/[team-slug]/members/

Adding a new member to a team:

.. http:post:: /api2/partners/teams/[team-slug]/members/

Updating a team member (e.g. changing their role):

.. http:put:: /api2/partners/teams/[team-slug]/members/[username]/

Removing a user from a team:

.. http:delete:: /api2/partners/teams/[team-slug]/members/[username]/

Example of adding a new user:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "username": "test-user",
        "role": "manager"
    }

Roles
+++++

* ``owner``
* ``admin``
* ``manager``
* ``contributor``

.. warning:: Changed behavior: the previous functionality was moved the Safe
    Team Member Resource documented below.

Permissions
+++++++++++

If a user belongs to a partner team, any admin or above on any of the partner's
teams can move the user anywhere within the partner's teams.  Moving is done by
first adding the user to the target team and then by removing the user from the
originating team.

Safe Team Member Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This resource behaves the same as the normal Team Member resource with one
small difference.  When you add a user to a team, we will send an invitation to
the user to join the team.  If the user doesn't exist, we will create it.  The
standard Team Member resource simply adds the user to the team and returns.

Listing:

.. http:get:: /api2/partners/teams/[team-slug]/safe-members/

Adding a new member to a team:

.. http:post:: /api2/partners/teams/[team-slug]/safe-members/

Project Resource

    :query status: What status the application is at, possible values are 'Denied', 'Approved', 'Pending', 'Member Removed' and 'Member Left'

Note that if an application is pending (has the status='Pending'), the API can
set it to whatever new status. Else, if the application has already been
approved or denied, you won't be able to set the new status. For cases were an
approval was wrongly issues, you'd want to remove the team member. Otherwise
you'd want to invite the user to the team.
